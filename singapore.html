            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                After the First World War, Singapore was chosen by Britain to be a site of a 
                huge new military base due to its strategic location. Yet this project was plagued with issues even
                before the Japanese conquest of Malaya. The area lacked significant naval protection. Moreover, while the surrounding
                jungle was thought to be inpassable it was no great challenge to the Japanese who were dead set on Japan's expansion.
                <br /><br />
                And on the 8th of February they struck the weakest part of the base, succesfully establishing a beachhead and ultimately leading to the fall of singapore.
            </p>
            <h2>Account of the battle</h2>
            <p>
                The battle, or rather fall of Singapore was a catastrophe that saw some of the worst events in the region. The forces stationed there were ill-prepared and underfunded, leading to critical problems with the defence of the island. The Allied force was spread too thin and was unable to defend the oncoming amphibious onslaught of the Japanese, even though they outnumbered them. 
                <br /><br />
                The Japanese troops were much better prepared both in terms of equipment and skill, and already had tremendous success under general Yamashito during the conquest of Malaya. The Japanese also had easily established air superiority, again due to the forces in Singapore being unprepared. Very quickly Percival was left with very few flyable aircraft, which only reinforced the Japanese amphibious assault.
                <br /><br />
                The battle was also the site of horrendous war crimes and massacres committed by the Japanese, such as the Alexandra Hospital Massacre, where over 50 soldiers, doctors and nurses in the hospital (some undergoing surgery) were killed after an envoy was killed with a bayonet. Those who survived were ordered to march and kept in inhumane conditions, all while being injured and constantly threatened with death.
                <br /><br />
                Very quickly both the military and civilians had to withdraw to a small part of the island where the failing water system and lacking food reserves were unable to sustain the large population crammed into such a small space. A counterattack was considered impossible (though later analysis disagreed) and Percival issued the order to capitulate.                
            </p>
            <h2>Significance & Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
                The Battle of Singapore, is also known as the Fall of Singapore for good reason. It led to the capture of over 130 thousand Commonwealth troops and to the loss
                of a vital foothold in the pacific. Without it, the Allies were unable to defend the rest of the region, leading to the eventual capture of Java and completion
                of the Japanese plan. Additionally, it delt a heavy blow to British morale due to the scale of the capitulation while also being a majour propagandistic victory
                for Japan, which didn't shy away from boasting about it in newspapers for weeks.
                <br /> <br />
                The Fall of Singapore was one of the most significant battles in the region both for propagandistic and military reasons, being compared to the battle at Dunkirk by some.
