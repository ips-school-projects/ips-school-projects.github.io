                After the success of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans had advanced deep into the
                soviet union. And they were set on their next target: the city of Stalingrad on the Volga river.
                Capturing this city would mean a great strategic and propagandistic victory for the Wermacht.

                And on the 17th of July, 1942 the Germans attacked the city.
