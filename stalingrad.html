            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                After the success of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans had advanced deep into the <br />
                Soviet Union. And they were set on their next target: the city of Stalingrad on the Volga river. <br />
                Capturing this city would mean a great strategic and propagandistic victory for the Wermacht. <br />
                <br />
                And on the 17th of July, 1942 the Germans attacked the city.
            </p>
            <h2>Account of the battle</h2>
            <p>
                The battle was long and brutal, involving hundereds of thousands of troops and hundereds of tanks.
                It started as an intense bombing by the Luftwaffe, primarily with incendiary bombs, destroying most of the city's wooden buildings.
                The Luftwaffe also targeted the Volga, with many commercial vessels sunk it was clear the river was rendered useless for shipping.
                <br /><br/>
                The number of civilian casualties was immense, estimated at around 40 thousand.
                Some believe it was Stalin's order that led to the civilians not being evacuated,
                as Stalin believed that troops would fight better knowing they are protecting civilians, and not fighting for an empty city.
                <br /><br />
                
                As the fighting continued, so did the temperatures, dropping to as low as -20˚C.
                These conditions hurt morale on both sides, and made fighting unbearable for troops.
                Additionally, the fighting transitioned to fierce urban warfare, where troops fought from house to house,
                fighting over every inch of space.
                <br /><br />

                Then, generals Georgy Zhukov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky planned the massive counterattack and encircling operation known as Operation Uranus.
                This left the Sixth Army surrounded; and with an ever-tightening noose of the Soviets and the weather alike Paulus was forced to surrender,
                putting an end to the bloody conflict.
                <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h2>Significance & Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
                The battle marked a turning point of the Second World War.
                It was the first failure of the Nazi army acknowledged by Hitler.
                It was both a propagandistic and strategic failure as Germany failed to secure the vital oil fields in the Caucasuses, as well as failing to capture the city named after Stalin.
                This led to a drop in morale for the Axis, but a significant boost in morale of the Soviets.
                Things only went downhill for Germany from here, with the Nazis being pushed back all the way to Berlin.
                <br /> <br />
                Arguably, the Battle of Stalingrad was the single most significant event during World War 2.
